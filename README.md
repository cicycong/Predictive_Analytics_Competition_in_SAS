# Predictive_Analytics_Competition_in_SAS
Using predictive modeling to predict how many and which individuals to target for a fundraising campaign.

The dataset mainly contains socioeconomics status like age and education levelï¼Œ and previous 10 years donation situation of the members. There are 10 million observations in the dataset. Please refer to [Know_The_Game.pdf](https://github.com/cicycong/Predictive_Analytics_Competition_in_SAS/blob/main/Know%20the%20Game.pdf) for the detailed description of the data. The data is stored in [Data.zip](https://github.com/cicycong/Predictive_Analytics_Competition_in_SAS/blob/main/Data.zip).

This project applied logistic regression to predict the probability that a member would donate when being contacted and not being contacted, and multilinear regression model to the amount that a member would donate when being contacted and not being contacted. The expected donation for each member is calculated by mutiplying the predicted probability and predicted amount. The difference of predicted amount under being contact and not being contact is the uplift generated by contacting a member. The final decision is made based on surplus(uplift - cost of contacting) of contacting a member.
